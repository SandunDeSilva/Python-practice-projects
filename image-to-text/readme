Install Tesseract (System-level)

    Tesseract is not a Python package, you need to install the actual OCR engine first:
        On Windows:
        Download the installer from:
            https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

        Choose the latest .exe file (e.g., tesseract-ocr-w64-setup.exe) and install it.
            During installation, make sure to check the box for “Add Tesseract to the system path” or manually add its path later (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).

Then install below packages
pip install tesseract
pip install pytesseract
