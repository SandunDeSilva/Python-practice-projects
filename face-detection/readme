# Face Detection with OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect **faces** in real-time using your webcam.

# Features

- Detects **faces** using a pre-trained Haar cascade model
- Uses webcam for real-time video capture
- Draws a green rectangle around each detected face
- Cleanly exits when the **`Esc` key** is pressed
- Simple and lightweight â€” no external models needed

# Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
